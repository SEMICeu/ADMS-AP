# ADMS-AP

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of the ADMS Application Profile for Joinup.

The Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) is a vocabulary to describe reusable solutions, such as data models and specifications, reference data and open source software. On 1 August 2013, W3C published ADMS as a W3C Working Group note (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-adms/).

The ADMS specification was originally drafted to describe semantic interoperability solutions (previously referred to as semantic assets). This application profile of ADMS aims to extend the use of ADMS for the description of other types of interoperability solutions, meaning solutions covering the political, legal, organisational and technical interoperability layers defined by the European Interoperability Framework (https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif).

The changes made from version 1.0 to 2.0 have been collected in an Annex, on the specifications. The alignment between DCAT and ADMS could be considered the main change of the new version, i.e. the use of DCAT classes instead of ADMS classes.
